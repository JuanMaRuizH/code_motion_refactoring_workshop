###Problem Statement

We want to create a billing system for a new upcoming hostel called “Travel Back Hostels”.
Currently we have a few rooms with 4 beds each.

Assumptions:
- All the charges are per day:
- The cost per person is 20€.
- The whole room can be booked. In this case, for every empty bed in the room, the charge is 10€
- For every booking, there is a charge of 10€ as administration fee.
- Assume that the room availability is not an issue.

**System constraints:** 
- At a time, you can only book 4 or less beds.

###Extension Part 1:

My business is doing well and so I have added more rooms with 8 beds. 
The new prices are as follows: 
* For room with 4 beds, price per bed is 20€. If you want to book the whole room, then for each empty bed, you pay 10€ 
* For room with 8 beds, price per bed is 15€. If you want to book the whole room, then for each empty bed, you pay 5€
* All the other charges remain the same.
